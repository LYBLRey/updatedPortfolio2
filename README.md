# UpdatedPortfolio2

## Description

My motivation for this project was to FURTHER illustrate my growth as a full-stack developer in a short time thanks to UWS Continuing Education's Coding Bootcamp presented by Trilogy!
I built this project to present my most recent (AND COMPLETED/WORKING) projects!
The problem that this solves compared to my last updated portfolio submission, is that this one has an included avatar, actual working navbar clicks (like resume going to an actual pdf)
This project helped me realize I should update my GitHub and LinkedIn accordingly so it is up-to-date and neat!
